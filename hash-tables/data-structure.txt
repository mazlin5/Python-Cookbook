1. pass key into h(f) and returns address or index 
     - generates a value of fixed len
2. efficient data access
    - pass key and retreive index 
3. insert, lookup, delete, search - o(1)

# dict = hash table data structure 
user = {
    age: 54,
    name: 'malik',
    magic: true,
    scream: function() {
        print('hello)
    }
}

user[i] = key  o(1)

******* KNOW ******

fundamental differences you can pretty much only point out that dict values are accessible by keys, 
which could be of any immutable type, while list values are indexed with integers. That's it :-)
