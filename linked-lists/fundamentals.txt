LINKED lists
------------

1. linked lists do not have indexes
2. nodes spread out through memory using pointers
3. head points to [0] tail [last]
4. normal lists are contiguous in memory (index)

1. appending to head or tail = O(1)
2. appending at center of list = O(n)
    -- traverse though list and find node then insert
3. removing from middle
        - .pop() - traverse = O(n)
4. find a # by value = O(n)
5. node = value and pointer - a dictionary
