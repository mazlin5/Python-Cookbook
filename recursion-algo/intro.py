# function that calls itself until it doesn't
# each time we complete a process (base case) - list gets smaller
# recursive case means it keeps iterating 
# to prevent stack overflow - return statement (=stop running code)

# 1 when a function makes one more calls to itself
# perform repetitive tasks
