# lookup o(n)  :  pop,push, peek o(1)
# LIFO - need to know very last value that was added
# Examples------ 
# browser history, re-do function - store previous state in memory so recent comes first


# Question - write a MinMaxStack class that supports:
# pushing and poping  values on off the stack
# peeking at value at top
# getting both min and max value at anytime 

# [1, 2 ,3]
# push
# [3
#  2
#  1]  pop() pulls 3

# peek()- returns top element of stack but doesn't remove from stack k
